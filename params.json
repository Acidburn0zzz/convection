It exposes a DSL for template definition, and a simple, decoupled abstraction of a CloudFormation Stack to compile and apply templates.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nPlease read our [Contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on contributing to Convection.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'convection'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install convection\r\n\r\n##CLI Commands\r\n###### Converging\r\n- To converge all stacks in your cloudfile run `convection converge`. If you provide the name of your stack as a additional argument such as `convection converge my-stack-name` then all stacks above and including the stack you specified will be converged.\r\n\r\n###### Diff\r\n- To display diff between your local changes and the version of your stack in cloud formation of your changes run `convection diff`.\r\n\r\n###### Help\r\n- To print out a list of available cli options with their descriptions run `convection help`.\r\n\r\n###### Print\r\n- To print out the cloud formation template for a specific stack run `convection print my-stack-name`.\r\n\r\n###### Validate\r\n- To validate your stack is not missing a required resource run `convection validate my-stack-name`.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nWe highly recommend consulting the [getting started guide](./docs/getting-started.md) for a in depth walk through on how to to set up your project and create and deploy a stack. Example stacks and resources are available in the [convection/example](https://github.com/rapid7/convection/tree/master/example) folder\r\n\r\n## License\r\n_Copyright (c) 2015 John Manero, Rapid7 LLC._\r\n\r\n```\r\nMIT License\r\n===========\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
